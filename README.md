# CSCI111-Introduction-to-Computer-Science
CSCI-111 introduced problem-solving in computer science beyond programming. Using Python and Linux, we designed algorithms, built applications, and learned debugging. Projects included a movie review organizer, a library system, encryption with Vigen√®re ciphers, and a final dataset analysis, applying loops and classes to extract business insights.
