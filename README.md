# CSCI111-Introduction-to-Computer-Science
Lastly and ironically, I finished the data science minor with an introductory course in the computer science department. However, CSCI111: Introduction to Computer Science is more than just an introduction to programming. Professor Tolley described it as “an exploration of the fundamental problem-solving techniques that are at the core of computer science.” Sure, we learned how to write code, but we also learned how to think like computer scientists. 

In the course, we covered many broad topics. First, we designed and implemented algorithms for solving a wide variety of problems. Secondly, we got an introduction to the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of Python and Linux. Thirdly, we had access to several programming applications, including numerical computation, text processing, graphics, and networking. Lastly, we developed systematic techniques for testing and debugging programs. This ensured that we not only wrote code but also understood how to make it robust. 

For my first project, I created a movie review organizer. It was designed to manage and analyze user reviews for movies. It allows users to interact with the system via a menu, performing tasks like adding and displaying reviews, and calculating the average review length for each movie. Building off the movie review organizer, I created a library management system with three main classes: Book, Library, and Member. It allows managing books in a library, including adding, removing, and listing books, and enables library members to borrow and return books. 

In the next project, I expanded my understanding of encryption by implementing the Vigenère cipher, a more advanced method compared to the Caesar cipher. I used a keyword to shift letters and applied modular arithmetic for string manipulation. I incorporated conditionals and loops to manage the encryption and decryption processes and used debugging techniques to ensure my code worked correctly. To make my implementation more efficient, I reduced redundant code by combining the encryption and decryption functionalities into one streamlined function. 

The final project was titled “Superstore Sales Analysis.” I analyzed and extracted meaningful insights from a Superstore Sales dataset while practicing programming concepts like loops, lists, dictionaries, and classes. By the end of the project, I created a fully functional Python script and a professional report summarizing my findings.
